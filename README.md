1. Introduction
This assignment helped me to consolidate the concepts learnt in the session.

2. Problem Statement

Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set
We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data set from
Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers and can be used to
predict whether a passenger survived or not.

<b>Url</b> = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigDataGal/Python-for-Data-Science/master/titanic-train.csv

I have used only Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp (Siblings aboard), Parch (Parents/children aboard),
and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived.
